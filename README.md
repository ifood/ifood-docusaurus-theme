> iFood's official Docusaurus theme

## About

This project was created to provide a consistent experience trought iFood project's documentations using Docusaurus. It relies in [Swizzling](https://docusaurus.io/docs/swizzling) feature of Docusaurus, which allows deeper site customizations. Swizzling permits to swap a theme component with our implementation. Thanks to this feature and all customization given to us by the tool, we could easily create this theme.

> Note: It's currently unstable due the not full support to themes from Docusaurus. If there's any problem with the usage, please open an issue.
